APIs USED:

The doctor's sign in module was make using SQUARE's CUSTOMER API.
Along with that we used Google Cloud's Maps API in our flask based webapp.





RUNNING THE WEBAPP:

** The computer needs to have Python and pip installed **

1) First we need to create a virtual environment by opening a terminal and directing it to the directory of the app.
2) We then run "pipenv update" to get the the necessary dependencies installed.
2) Then we can run "pipenv flask run"
3) Run "npm start" on a separate terminal that is redirected to "Curatio/Video Module"
4) Run /misc/remove_doctor_db.py to clear all "customers" data
